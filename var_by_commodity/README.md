### Purpose

Identify commodities with most price variance that could be indicative of trade mis-invoicing.

### Method

This script calculates the [coefficient of variation](standard deviation / mean) for unit price across commodities.  For each commodity, for each month, the standard deviation and mean of unit price (`value/quantity_1`) is calculated across all country pairs.

This simple measure controls for the magnitude of the unit price which will be quite large for expensive goods (gold or laptops) but low for cheap goods (cement or bricks).  However, it does not capture any of the nuance in variations across time or any other dimension.  There are certainly more sophisticated methods to measure this (some within this repo), but this method does flag some low hanging fruit commodities with egrigious unit price variation.

### Filters & Caveats

This provides a framework for a for calculating the variance in commodity unit prices across all commodities.  However, in the current state, some naive assumptions and filters are applied.

* Imports into into EU/USA/Japan (`is_import=='t'`) are reported separately from the exports from these countries (`is_import=='f'`).  
* Only goods priced in euros (`currency=='EUR'`).  Can be improved w/ [@margaretmf]'s exchange rate code.
* Only shipments measured in kilograms (`unit_1_id==24`)
* Only shipments valued at > 1 in quantity and value (`quantity_1>0 & value>1 & is.na(value)==F`) 

### How to Read Output

* `commodity_id`: commodity_id from trade table
* `sum_value`: sum of `value` (Euros) from trade table across all trade for the given commodity (summed across countries and months)
* `sd_unit1price`: coefficient of variation (sd/mean) of unit price (`value`/`quantity_1`) across all trades for the given commodity (across months and countries)
* `country_id_cnt`: count of unique countries exporting the given commodity
* `src_country_id_cnt`: count of unique countries importing the given commodity.
* `hs_code`: hs_code from commodity table
* `hs_description`: description of good from commodity table
* `anomalous_src_country`: top 3 countries w most unit price deviation.  Measured by the absolute value of the difference between the average unit price (across months) for each a country from the average unitprice across all countries.
* `anomalous_country`: same calculation as `anomalous_src_country`, but for `country_id`.
* `country_list_sortby_value` (not pictured here for brevity): list of all exporting countries sorted from most to least volume (measured by `value`) of the given commodity.
* `src_country_list_sortby_value`: same as `country_list_sortby_value`, but for the reporting source country (EU/Japan/USA).

### Raw Data Sample for Most Price-Variant Commodities

As a convenience, for the top commodities flagged in these lists with the most variance, we export the raw records from the `trade` table.  We used this as a sanity check when developing and testing this methodology.   We intend for it to be used as a reference when investigating and developing intuitions into why these commodities show so much unit-price variance.
